Hyde Project README File

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the README file for the devdaily.com Hyde project.
In short, if you're a Mac user, Hyde lets you hide your
desktop.

Although it's written in Java, Hyde has been customized for
the Mac, and once it's properly built, it installs just like
any other Mac application.


DEMO
----

The best way to learn about Hyde is to see a few pictures and
watch a short video. You can find all those goodies here:

SOUNDS
------

In addition to the base functionality, you can add sound effects
to Hyde. Just look in the Hyde Preferences to see how to
add sound effects to Hyde.


BULDING HYDE
------------

If you have Java and Ant installed, you can build Hyde. Just cd 
to the build directory, and type "ant". Or, take a look at the
build.xml file in that directory for more information.
